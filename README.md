# ChatRF – AI-Enhanced Ham Radio Repeater

**ChatRF** is a modular Python-based ham radio repeater system enhanced with an embedded conversational AI assistant.
Designed for amateur radio enthusiasts, this project integrates real-time AI interaction, audio signal processing, DTMF command handling, weather updates, satellite tracking, callsign lookups, and more, all through standard RF equipment and a local computer (e.g., Raspberry Pi).

The current version is very early but includes all features mentioned below.

## 📡 What is ChatRF?

ChatRF is a software controller for repeater systems that:
- Allows traditional RF repeater functionality.
- Transmits automatic CW ID.
- Responds to DTMF touch-tone commands for live interaction.
- Offers conversational responses using a **local** LLM (default: `gemma3` via Ollama).
- Serves as a flexible framework for ham-related features accessible by voice.

### ❓ Why ChatRF?

Ham radio has always been about innovation, but repeaters have barely changed since the 90s. ChatRF brings smart interaction to the airwaves, letting hams access real-time information, converse with an LLM, and explore modular features entirely over RF, without the internet.

## 🎯 Core Features

### ✅ Repeater System
- Detects and forwards incoming transmissions with changeable silence detection.
- Periodic Morse code ID.
- Interacts via DTMF for feature control.

### 🤖 AI Assistant ("AI Mode")
- Records and transcribes voice using `faster-whisper`.
- Generates replies with a local LLM using Ollama.
- Runs entirely offline — no internet required once set up.
- Speaks responses via `piper-tts`.
- Plays a “thinking melody” during processing.
- Automatically exits on timeout.
- Custom system prompt optimized for ham radio conversations.

### 🌐 Modules
- **Callsign Lookup**: Translates phonetic alphabet input into callsigns, then checks against the RadioID database.
- **Satellite Tracking**: Uses Skyfield + TLEs to report upcoming satellite passes.
- **HF Band Conditions**: Pulls solar/propagation info from hamqsl.com.
- **Weather Reports**: Via OpenWeatherMap API.
- **Voice Output**: All responses spoken using `piper-tts`.

## 🛠 Modular Design

- Easy to extend — plug in your own DTMF features.
- Independent modules for audio, logic, AI, etc.
- Designed with maintainability and experimentation in mind.

---

## 🌍 Language Support

- Default language: Greek.
- Easy to customize for any spoken language.
- AI responses are phrased for maximum intelligibility over radio.
